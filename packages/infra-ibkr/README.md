# infra-ibkr

Interactive Brokers leaf adapter. Imports `algotrading.infra` + `algotrading.core`, nothing
above (enforced by import-linter).

## Is the gateway live? Check the real path — do not `curl /`

Before you ever conclude the gateway is down or "needs a login," check it the way the code does,
not with a bare `curl`. A plain `GET https://localhost:5000/` returns a **302 to `/sso/Login`
even when the brokerage session is fully authenticated** — that landing page is always served on
`/`. Reading that redirect as "not logged in" is a false blocker; it has cost real time.

The authoritative signal is `GET /iserver/auth/status` (`authenticated: true`), which
`CpRestSession.authenticated()` wraps. The one-liner, through the real code path:

```
IBKR_CP_GATEWAY=1 uv run python -c "from algotrading.infra_ibkr.session_factory import build_gateway_session; _t, s = build_gateway_session(establish=False); print('authenticated:', s.authenticated())"
```

`authenticated: true, connected: false` means the SSO cookie is still valid and the brokerage
session just went idle — `session.reauthenticate()` revives it with **no SMS / no new login**
(this is what `scripts/eod_babysitter.py` rides). Only a `False` from `authenticated()` is a real
"log in" blocker; the browser login is `scripts/ibkr_gateway_login.py`. The session lifecycle
itself lives in `connectivity/cp_rest_session.py`.

## Two ingestion paths, one `RawMarketEvent`

IBKR has **two** market-data paths; both normalize into our immutable `RawMarketEvent` (the system
of record), so the actor host replays either identically. The path is chosen by config
(`select_ibkr_transport`); **REST is preferred**, Nautilus-TWS is the manual-flip fallback (no automatic failover). Both build events through the shared `collectors/market_fields.py`
helper, so they emit **byte-identical** rows for the same observation — the equivalence bar proven
in `tests/test_cp_rest_equivalence.py`.

### Client Portal REST/WebSocket (preferred — the course requirement)

A custom adapter over IBKR's Client Portal Web API (`httpx`/`websockets`, real deps):

- `connectivity/cp_rest_transport.py` — `CpRestTransport`: REST verbs + the WS URL over the local
  CP Gateway (`https://localhost:5000`, self-signed cert). `_client` injectable for tests. The
  429/503 retry rides tenacity (audit M20) with the unchanged cadence — `Retry-After` honoured
  when sane, else `backoff_base * 2**retry_index`, injected `sleep` — and a failed call raises
  `CpRestTransportError` carrying `status_code` directly (no `__cause__` reach). The
  transport-seam protocol (`SupportsRestGet` / `SupportsRest`) every collector types its injected
  transport with is re-exported here; its one definition lives in
  `algotrading.infra.collectors.transport_seam` (audit M40).
- `connectivity/cp_rest_order_submit.py` — `CpRestOrderSubmit`: the **separate, gated order-submit
  verb** (`submit` POSTs `/iserver/account/{id}/orders`). It is a *new, explicit* class, deliberately
  **not** a method on the read-only ingestion transport or the market-data adapter — folding order
  submission into the read path would break the read-only invariant. Reached only by the
  3B execution send path (`algotrading.execution.transmit`) behind its owner gate; nothing wires it
  by default (`test_cp_rest_order_submit.py` pins both the order POST and that the ingestion adapter
  still never touches an order endpoint).
- `connectivity/cp_rest_session.py` — `CpRestSession`: the brokerage-session lifecycle TWS hid —
  `/iserver/auth/status` + a daemon-thread `/tickle` keepalive (~60 s; the session dies after ~5 min
  of silence). A dropped session fires `on_drop`, the engine's reconnect signal;
  `reauthenticate()` (POST `/iserver/reauthenticate`) revives a lapsed brokerage session without
  a fresh login — the self-heal `scripts/eod_babysitter.py` rides.
- `collectors/cp_rest_wire.py` — the typed CP wire shapes (pydantic v2, `extra="ignore"`): one
  model per payload (`SnapshotRow`, `SecdefSearchRow`, `StrikesPayload`, `SecdefInfoRow`,
  `HistoryBarRow`) with the bespoke broker-scalar coercers moved **verbatim** into
  `BeforeValidator` types (`parse_field_value` is hash-gated — it feeds persisted events), so
  every collector consumes one validated shape instead of `isinstance`-spelunking `Any`.
- `collectors/cp_rest_normalize.py` — `snapshot_to_events`: a validated `SnapshotRow` (CP field
  tags `84`→bid, `86`→ask, `88`/`85`→sizes, `31`→last, `7059`→last size; the `-1` sentinel
  dropped) → `RawMarketEvent`; one normalizer serves both the REST snapshot and the WS frame.
- `collectors/cp_rest_snapshot.py` — the shared snapshot engine: URI-safe conid batching (the
  HTTP-414 fix) + cold-snapshot warm-up polling, used by **both** the live adapter and the EOD
  close capture, so neither path re-rolls a bare single-shot request.
- `collectors/cp_rest_discovery.py` — `CpRestDiscovery`: the mandatory `secdef/search → strikes →
  info` sequence (the `name` field **omitted** on search, or strikes are suppressed).
- `collectors/cp_rest_adapter.py` — `CpRestMarketDataAdapter`: REST `snapshot()` (through the
  shared snapshot engine — batched, warm-up polled) + WS frame handling → `RawMarketEvent`.
  **Read-only** — only `/iserver/marketdata/*` is ever touched, never an order endpoint (asserted
  in `test_cp_rest_adapter.py`).

### Historical daily-OHLC backfill — unattended, OAuth 1.0a

The history path the live snapshot path lacks: years of underlying daily OHLC into the immutable,
provider-partitioned `DailyBar` table (WS 1C, Part C). Runs unattended over the hosted CP Web API
with **in-house OAuth 1.0a** (no TWS/IB Gateway, no daily interactive login).

- `connectivity/cp_rest_oauth.py` — the OAuth 1.0a per-request signer (referencing `ibind`, not
  depending on it): `signature_base_string` (RFC 5849 §3.4.1), `sign_hmac_sha256` (LST-keyed
  per-request signature), `sign_request`, `authorization_header` (with the IBKR `realm`), and
  `make_oauth_signer` — the factory that turns `OAuthCredentials` into the
  `(method, url, query) → headers` `OAuthSigner` the transport injects. Pure crypto, no
  clock/nonce read (both injected) → a hand-computed known-answer vector pins it
  (`test_cp_rest_oauth.py`). A missing/expired token raises a labeled `CpOAuthError`.
- `connectivity/cp_rest_lst.py` — **Live Session Token acquisition** on **pycryptodome** (the half
  the signer leaves out): the RSA-SHA256-signed `oauth/request_token`, the
  Diffie–Hellman exchange (`oauth/live_session_token`), and the LST derivation
  (`K = B^a mod p`; LST = base64(HMAC-SHA1(K, prepend))), validated against IBKR's returned
  signature. `build_signed_cp_rest_transport` is the **production entry point**: it runs the
  exchange, builds `make_oauth_signer` from the derived LST, and returns a `CpRestTransport` with
  that signer injected — so the production path (not just tests) signs every request. The two
  exchange POSTs are RSA-signed (the LST does not exist yet); the HTTP POST is injected so the
  gate drives a fake IBKR endpoint whose DH side is computed independently
  (`test_cp_rest_lst_production.py`). The network is never opened in pytest.
- `connectivity/cp_rest_transport.py` — extended with an optional `oauth_signer`: when set, every
  request carries the `Authorization: OAuth …` header (the hosted-endpoint path); left `None` it is
  the unchanged local-Gateway cookie path.
- `connectivity/cp_rest_session.py` — extended with the brokerage-session open: `open_brokerage_
  session` (POST `ssodh/init`) and `wait_until_established` — blocks (injected sleep, no real wait)
  until the session reports `established: true`, raising `SessionNotEstablishedError` otherwise, so
  a history request is never fired into a not-yet-established session.
- `collectors/cp_rest_history_normalize.py` — `history_to_daily_bars`: a CP `marketdata/history`
  payload → `DailyBar` rows; each bar's `trade_date` is read from its **own** epoch-ms timestamp
  (no look-ahead). Malformed rows (`high < low`, close out of range, negative volume, NaN, missing
  field) are rejected with a labeled error at the normalize door.
- `collectors/cp_rest_history.py` — `CpRestHistoryCollector`: fetch + normalize + persist, hardened — established-gated, warmup call, 5-concurrent cap, exponential-with-cap retry
  around maintenance windows, and **resumable** (`backfill` re-fetches only the missing tail;
  idempotent on `(provider, underlying, trade_date)`). **Read-only** — only
  `/iserver/marketdata/history`, never an order endpoint (`test_cp_rest_history.py`). Use a
  **dedicated second IBKR username** so the backfill never knocks out the live feed (one username =
  one brokerage session).
- `config.py` + `configs/ibkr_history.yaml` — the no-hardcode connectivity config (base URL,
  timeouts, the cap, established-wait, retry/backoff), validated through frozen, strict pydantic
  models (the REP6 config seam); a rejected field raises a labeled `IbkrHistoryConfigError`.
  Secrets (consumer key/secret, the Live Session Token) stay in `.env`, never here (C7
  discipline).

### Live EOD close capture — `collect_live` (WS 1C)

The source that closes the broker→raw-event seam: the EOD runner (`algotrading.infra`, a layer
*below* this one) exposes a transport-agnostic `BasketSource` and a `basket_source` parameter on
`build_default_deps`/`default_stages_builder`; this leaf provides the live source and the
credential-driven selection. The runner never imports the broker leaf — the cross-layer wiring
lives only in the `scripts/eod_run.py` shim, which is outside the root gate.

- `connectivity/cp_rest_credentials.py` — the `.env` → `LstConsumer` loader the OAuth work
  flagged as missing. Reads the `IBKR_CP_*` artifacts (consumer key, access token + encrypted
  secret, the two RSA PEM **file paths**, DH prime, optional generator/realm) into the
  `LstConsumer` the LST flow needs, plus a real `httpx`-backed `post` for the two exchange
  endpoints. Absent creds → `None` (clean no-capture); partial creds → a labeled `CpOAuthError`
  (`test_cp_rest_credentials.py`).
- `collectors/cp_rest_index.py` — `resolve_index` / `resolve_index_conid`: resolve an index's
  conid (and its listed option months) from its symbol via `GET /iserver/secdef/search`
  (`secType=IND`, matched to the routing exchange CBOE/EUREX). The live path resolves the conid
  itself, so the registry's `conid: 0` placeholder is **unused** on the live path. The sibling
  `option_months_for_conid` reads the listed option months for an *already-resolved* underlying
  conid (a pinned constituent, or one resolved by a `STK` search) by a **conid-keyed** search, so
  a pinned ambiguous ticker still reads the right months (`test_cp_rest_index.py`).
- `collectors/cp_rest_close_capture.py` — `collect_target_basket` (the underlying-generic capture
  body) + `collect_live_basket` (the index wrapper) + the `CaptureTarget` descriptor. The capture
  **orchestration**, factored over a small `CaptureTarget` (symbol / search-symbol / exchange /
  currency / sec-type / conid) so the index lane and the constituent lane share it byte-for-byte:
  resolve conid → snapshot spot → discover + `plan_chain` the option chain → cap with
  `select_capture_keys` → snapshot the selected contracts at the close → **gate on quote
  integrity** → assemble the `IndexBasket` `run_analytics` consumes. Every event is stamped at the
  index's own `session_close`; a snapshot row stamped *after* the close is dropped (no look-ahead)
  (`test_cp_rest_close_capture.py`). The economic 30Δ delta-band selection runs downstream in the
  analytics over the captured set. The snapshot mechanics live in `cp_rest_snapshot.py` (above);
  the window policy lives in `cp_rest_chain_window.py` (below). Two EMERGENCY guards live here:
  - **Concurrent discovery** (EMERGENCY-capture-throughput). `_discover_chain` runs the
    per-`(month, strike, right)` `/secdef/info` walk through a **bounded** `ThreadPoolExecutor`
    (`httpx.Client` is thread-safe) instead of strictly sequentially — a latency-bound walk (each
    call is ~all network wait) that, serial, smears a "close" across 30–60 min on the full basket.
    The pool width is **typed config** (`StrikeSelectionConfig.discovery_pool_size`, default 6,
    `universe.yaml` — never a `.py` literal); a width of 1 is the sequential walk. The
    discovery calls are independent and the assembled chain is order-independent (sorted-set
    expirations/strikes, a token-keyed conid dict), so the concurrent walk is **byte-identical** to
    the sequential one — the same calls, faster, never fewer (the strike window is untouched: an
    owner ruling). The transport's existing 429/503 backoff stays the pacing valve; the per-walk
    pool width is logged (`ibkr.close_capture.discovery_pool`). Locked by a parity test.
  - **Quote-integrity gate** (EMERGENCY-quote-integrity-gate). `_snapshot_events` classifies each
    kept OPTION row via the shared `assess_quote` machinery and **promotes only rows with a healthy
    two-sided quote** (positive, uncrossed bid AND ask) to the derived close set; a zero /
    single-sided / crossed row is *quarantined* — excluded from promotion with a recorded drop
    reason (`ibkr.close_capture.quarantine_row`), never deleted from `raw/`. If the *whole* basket
    falls below the typed two-sided floor (`QcThresholdConfig.quote_integrity.min_two_sided_fraction`,
    `qc.yaml`), `collect_target_basket` returns `None` — a **labelled no-capture**
    (`ibkr.close_capture.closed_market`), NOT a surface fit off last-only marks. This is the guard
    the 2026-06-15 SX5E canary needed: it banked a converged, arb-free surface off a *closed*
    market (every row `bid==ask<=0`, only `last` real). Distinct from the wrong-day
    `CloseCaptureError` (a look-ahead failure); a genuine two-sided close passes untouched.
- `collectors/cp_rest_constituent_capture.py` — `collect_index_and_constituents_basket`: widens
  the close capture to the index's **point-in-time top-N constituents by index weight** (the S1
  dispersion / implied-correlation input, TARGET §7.4). It captures the index leg (the spine), then
  resolves the top-N by weight (`UniverseConfig.constituent_top_n`, from 1A membership — never a
  hand-set list) through the shared `algotrading.infra.universe.top_n_by_weight` resolver,
  resolves each constituent's equity conid (verified `constituent_conids` pins first, then a `STK`
  search — the OHLC-backfill pattern), and captures each constituent's chain over the *same* grid /
  close instant via `collect_target_basket`, merging all captured underlyings into one
  `IndexBasket`. The analytics engine is already underlying-generic, so this is a *capture-scope*
  widening with no engine change.

  **Per-name outcome ledger (entitlement verdict).** Every attempted constituent records exactly
  one labelled `ConstituentCaptureOutcome` — `captured(n_options)` / `no_options` / `unentitled`
  (a 401/403 from the transport) / `unresolved` (conid would not resolve) — persisted to the
  `constituent_capture_outcomes` table under `…/underlying=<SYMBOL>`. This is how we learn *which*
  of the index's heaviest names return option chains on this account; the capture-coverage panel
  (`apps/frontend` `CoverageTable` + `/api/coverage`) surfaces it. A per-name failure never aborts
  the fire — one bad name is a recorded outcome, the rest still capture.

  **Cross-underlying concurrency — one shared gateway budget** (ibkr-capture-cross-underlying-concurrency).
  The index spine runs first (it gates whether constituents are swept and its failure still fails the
  fire); the N constituents then capture **concurrently**, not one after another. The lever is one
  shared bounded budget: the injected transport is wrapped once in a single `threading.BoundedSemaphore`
  (`connectivity.cp_rest_transport.bounded_transport`) of width `StrikeSelectionConfig.capture_pool_size`
  (typed config, `universe.yaml`, default 6), and **every** gateway `.get` — the spine, the
  per-name conid resolution, and each name's within-underlying `/secdef/info` walk — draws a permit from
  it. So total in-flight gateway calls are bounded by that one number regardless of how the work
  decomposes: `discovery_pool_size` **composes into** the budget (shares its permits), it is **never
  multiplied** by it — the nested-pool 429-storm. A shared **semaphore**, not a shared executor: a permit
  is held only across one round-trip, so the nested pools cannot deadlock. A budget of 1 *is* the serial
  capture, so the output is **byte-identical** at any width (merge and ledger reassemble by rank; each
  chain folds in a sorted, content-addressed order). Locked by a parity test (serial vs concurrent → same
  basket + same ledger) and a ceiling test (total in-flight ≤ budget while names provably overlap); the
  fan-out budget is logged (`ibkr.constituent_capture.fanout`).

  **Fail-loud, never silent (EMERGENCY-constituent-lane-activation).** "Scope says constituents but
  zero were resolved/attempted" raises `ConstituentLaneError` (logged CRITICAL), so the runner
  exits non-zero and `OnFailure=` alerts fire — never the clean exit that hid the 2026-06-15 SX5E
  canary. The cases stay distinct: **no banked 1A membership** for the trade date → loud
  `ConstituentLaneError` naming the missing input (ingest a weighted source first); a **missing-weight
  basket** → loud `MembershipRankingError` from the shared resolver (you cannot rank what you do not
  know); **names resolved but all unentitled / no-options / unresolved** → a real, recorded outcome
  in the ledger (loud only if not one name could be attempted at all).
- `collectors/cp_rest_chain_window.py` — the discovery-window policy: `MMMYY` month-token
  parsing/bracketing (tenor-targeted discovery reaching the 2y/3y long end) and the
  **delta-driven, tenor-aware strike qualification** (T-delta-window): per expiry it qualifies
  the listed strikes that *contain* the 30Δ band at that tenor
  (`universe.select_discovery_strikes`, sized from the index spot and the conservative
  `strike_selection.discovery_working_vol`), so the band — whose strike width grows with √T — is
  delivered in full instead of clipped to ~ATM±1% by a fixed strike count. There is no strike cap
  (a cap would be the same intent-vs-delivery bound the fix removed); the only backstop is a
  fail-loud runaway valve (`DiscoveryRunawayError`) set far above any real listing.
- `live_capture.py` — `live_basket_source`: the explicit, logged live-vs-empty selection. A
  credentialed environment acquires an LST, builds the OAuth-signed transport, opens the
  brokerage session, and returns a `collect_live`-backed `BasketSource`; a non-credentialed one
  returns `None` so the runner falls back to its empty no-capture source (clean exit 0). When a
  `store` is passed (the production shim threads the runner's store) the bound source captures the
  **index + its top-N constituents** (`collect_index_and_constituents_basket`, reading the as-of
  membership from the store); with no store it captures the index only (the prior behaviour). The
  full path (auth-from-env → conid → capture → persisted grid) and the fallback are pinned in
  `test_live_capture_spine.py`; the store-wired constituent routing in
  `test_cp_rest_constituent_capture.py`.
- `live_capture.py` — `gateway_basket_source`: the **local CP Gateway** counterpart for when the
  Self-Service OAuth portal will not enrol (the "Enable OAuth Access → 400 not authenticated"
  wall). Keyed on the `IBKR_CP_GATEWAY` opt-in flag (not the `IBKR_CP_*` artifacts): it builds +
  establishes a **cookie-session** transport over the browser-logged-in `clientportal.gw`
  (`session_factory.build_gateway_session`, `oauth_signer=None`) and binds the *same* `collect_live`
  capture over it — no OAuth crypto, an attended path (the Gateway cookie lapses ~daily). Not set →
  `None`, so the `scripts/eod_run.py` shim falls through to the OAuth source, else the empty default.
  The flag gate, the bind-and-capture, and the establish handshake are pinned in
  `test_gateway_capture.py`.

### Read-only account read-path — positions / cash / fills (TARGET §5.9/§6, recon foundation)

The IBKR-side capability broker **reconciliation** reads from. The leaf had market-data ingestion
only; this is the strictly-read account collector the recon sub-lane of
`execution-operational-hardening` consumes (it feeds the broker side only — the diff/tolerance/
alert logic lives there, not here). It reuses the existing transport + session machinery; no new
transport.

- `collectors/cp_rest_account_wire.py` — the typed CP **account** wire shapes (pydantic v2,
  `extra="ignore"`, the `cp_rest_wire.py` pattern): `PositionRow` (`/portfolio/{accountId}/
  positions/{pageId}`), `LedgerRow` (`/portfolio/{accountId}/ledger`, one entry per currency +
  the synthetic `BASE`), `TradeRow` (`/iserver/account/trades`). Broker spellings (`avgCost`,
  `mktPrice`, `cashbalance`, `trade_time_r`) alias onto house names; the conid coercer is reused
  verbatim from `cp_rest_wire`. A malformed *row* is a `ValidationError` the collector records,
  never a coerced zero.
- `collectors/cp_rest_account.py` — `CpRestAccountCollector` / `collect_broker_account`: reads the
  three endpoints and normalizes into the frozen-seam contracts `BrokerPosition` /
  `BrokerCashBalance` / `BrokerFill`, bundled into one `BrokerAccountSnapshot` (`infra.contracts`).
  **Read-only** — only `/portfolio/*` and `/iserver/account/trades` GETs are ever touched, never
  an order endpoint (asserted in `test_cp_rest_account.py`, mirroring the market-data adapter's
  read-only assertion). Positions keep a **signed** quantity (short negative); fills are stamped
  at their **own venue time** (`trade_time_r` epoch-ms), never the read clock — no look-ahead. The
  transport, clock (`now_fn`), and the conid→`contract_key` resolver are injected (DI); the
  resolver defaults to `conid=<N>` (recon joins on the broker's conid). It does **not** submit
  orders, persist, or run recon — it hands back the typed snapshot. Lives in CI against a fake
  transport; live bring-up is a smoke run, not pytest.

### Nautilus TWS (fallback)

- `connectivity/nautilus_ibkr.py` — `build_data_client_config(...)`: the Nautilus
  `InteractiveBrokersDataClientConfig`, import-guarded on the `ibkr` extra
  (`IbkrExtraNotInstalled` when absent).
- `collectors/nautilus_normalize.py` — `quote_tick_to_events` / `trade_tick_to_events`: Nautilus
  `QuoteTick`/`TradeTick` → `RawMarketEvent`.

## What runs in CI

The gate is **broker-free**: no live CP Gateway, no TWS Gateway, no live socket, no secrets.

- The **normalizers**, **discovery**, **session keepalive** + **established-wait** (fake
  clock/transport), the adapter's **REST snapshot** + **WS frame** handling, the **OAuth 1.0a
  signer** (known-answer vector), the **LST acquisition** (real RSA→DH→LST on pycryptodome
  against a fake endpoint whose DH side is computed independently) and the **production
  transport-signing** seam, the **history fetch/normalize/backfill-resume** path, the
  **REST↔TWS equivalence** test, and the **live EOD close capture** (`collect_live` against a
  fake gateway: credential load → conid resolve → chain plan → close snapshot → basket →
  persisted grid, plus the no-look-ahead drop and the no-credentials fallback), and the
  **read-only account collector** (`cp_rest_account` against a fake transport: positions/cash/
  fills normalize into the broker contracts, the fill's own-venue-time stamp, the malformed-row
  rejection, and the read-only/no-order-endpoint assertion) all run in CI against fakes — the
  verifiable core.
- The Nautilus config builder's guard runs; its construction test skips without the `ibkr` extra.
- Live runs are a smoke script on a machine with the relevant Gateway, not pytest. Install the
  Nautilus-TWS path with `uv sync --extra ibkr`; the REST path needs the CP Gateway running locally.

## Superseded (deleted)

The hand-rolled `ib_async` modules (`connectivity/ibkr_transport.py`,
`collectors/ibkr_adapter.py`, `collectors/ibkr_discovery.py`, vendored) were
superseded by the two live transports (CP-REST + Nautilus-TWS) and have been
**deleted** along with their `importorskip("ib_async")` tests (2026-06 maintainability audit,
M21). The SDK-free replay test (`tests/test_real_sample_reconstruct.py`) exercises
IBKR through `snapshot_to_events`, so it runs unconditionally in the gate, against real
captured samples: `samples/{spy_real_2026-06-04,asml_real_2026-06-05}.json`.
