"""Public pricing entry points: style dispatch, and the A-contract adapter.

``price`` is the single call that turns a state vector into price and Greeks,
dispatching on exercise style. ``pricing_result`` projects a :class:`PriceGreeks`
into Workstream A's ``PricingResult`` contract, adding the monetized (cash) Greeks
and attaching a caller-supplied provenance stamp. The stamp is built by the caller
(with an injected ``calc_ts``), never here, so the pricer stays a pure function of
its inputs with no wall-clock read.

Cash-Greek conventions, per unit of underlying (the risk engine multiplies by the
contract multiplier and the held quantity):

* ``cash_delta = delta * spot`` — dollar value change for a 1.0 move in spot.
* ``cash_gamma = gamma * spot**2`` — dollar gamma; P&L of a move dS is about
  ``0.5 * cash_gamma * (dS / spot)**2``.
* ``cash_vega = vega * 0.01`` — dollar value change for a one-vol-point (1%) move.
