# TASKBOARD

The in-repo collision guard for a shared workspace with several humans and agents
working at once. **Before you start changing files, claim them here.** Clear your
claim when you're done. This is advisory, not enforced — it only works if every
actor reads and writes it, which is why `AGENTS.md` tells you to. What we actually
care about is the **working tree on the server staying clean**: everything canonical
under `packages/` and `apps/`, one tree, one gate. Branches are optional convenience,
not the goal.

When a task is finished, clear its row. The record of *what* was built and *why*
lives in the code, the per-directory READMEs, and the ADRs in `.agent/decisions/`;
finished task specs move to [`tasks/archive/`](archive/).

## Current phase: build the index options-analytics pipeline

> **▶ The destination: [`TARGET.md`](../TARGET.md)** — the owner's end-state capability map
> (position/risk, P&L attribution incl. Rho/Vanna/Volga + residual, surface engine, stress,
> execution/OMS, portfolio analytics, backtesting, strategy allocation) and the current
> end-of-week goal. New work is designed by diffing TARGET against this board.

> **▶ START HERE: [`documentation/roadmap-index-analytics.md`](../documentation/roadmap-index-analytics.md)
> is the plan of record for what we build next.** It sequences the work Phase 0 → Phase 3:
> index → point-in-time constituents → delta-band option chain → IV / surface / Greeks
> (decimal + dollar) → daily-close cron → operator front page, then Tab-2 risk/strategy, then
> an execution sketch. Read [`vision-medium-term.md`](../documentation/vision-medium-term.md)
> for the *why* and [`.agent/open-questions.md`](../.agent/open-questions.md) for the decisions
> behind it (OQ-1…6 are all ruled). The blueprint (`documentation/blueprint/`, ADR 0011) still
> overrides on any domain/formula conflict.

**Ground truth (2026-06-06):** the full root gate is **green** —
`uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy . && uv run lint-imports && uv run pytest -q` →
**805 passed, 16 skipped, 0 failed**, ruff clean, mypy clean (173 files), import-linter 2/2.
This is the **only** gate. There is one tree (`packages/` + `apps/`); the old flat `backend/`
is gone.

### The merge/convergence is closed

This repo and Vincent's independent build of the same system
(`github.com/Vincent-20-100/AlgoTrading`) were merged toward the max-union of both. That work
is **done**: the layered uv-workspace monorepo is the chassis, **Nautilus is the runtime spine**
([ADR 0023](../.agent/decisions/0023-nautilus-runtime-spine-and-library-leverage.md)), and the
whole system — core, the frozen `contracts` seam, storage, the analytics core, risk, QC/validation,
the Nautilus-hosted actor, orchestration/observability, and the three broker leaf adapters
(IBKR via Nautilus + a custom Client-Portal REST transport; Saxo + Deribit via our own adapters)
— is canonical in `packages/infra` with one frontend in `apps/frontend`. The four headline
acceptance tests (byte-identical replay, provenance, reconstruction, handover) run inside the root
gate. Vincent's repo is checked out read-only at **`Vincent's Code/`** (gitignored, not canonical)
as a source of inspiration; refresh with `git -C "Vincent's Code" pull`.

The convergence tasks **C1–C6 and C8** all landed and merged to `main`; their specs are in
[`tasks/archive/`](archive/) as the historical record, alongside the original A–E backbone and the
M0–M10 merge fan-out. The closed convergence runbook is
[`archive/CONVERGENCE-PLAN.md`](archive/CONVERGENCE-PLAN.md). **What remains from convergence is
C7 only** (config hardening — the standard landed as [ADR 0028](../.agent/decisions/0028-configuration-and-reproducibility-standard.md),
but most of the application is unbuilt; see below). The IBKR-REST course requirement landed
([ADR 0024](../.agent/decisions/0024-ibkr-rest-transport-alongside-tws.md) accepted); its evaluation
record is [`archive/ibkr-rest-api-evaluation.md`](archive/ibkr-rest-api-evaluation.md).

## What's next — the index-analytics build

The detailed per-workstream `tasks/` specs (C-series style) are written **per phase as Phase 0
closes**, per [`roadmap-index-analytics.md`](../documentation/roadmap-index-analytics.md) §6. The
sequence; **Phase 0 and Phase 1 are now fully specced** (per-workstream files, linked below), behind the library ADRs [0030](../.agent/decisions/0030-frontend-visualization-and-ui-library-stack.md)–[0033](../.agent/decisions/0033-analytical-storage-duckdb-polars-over-parquet.md). Critical path: P0 → 1J → 1A+1B → 1C → 1F → 1G+1H → 1I (1J foundational — index registry; 1D gated on P0.4, parallel; 1E folded into P0/1C).

> **▶ Priority + parallelism (owner, 2026-06-07).** A functional front (1I) on the real foundation is the **main goal** — but it is **not** a blocking gate: **advance every non-conflicting downstream task in parallel** (fan out agents). Only same-file/same-contract conflicts serialize.
> **Week sprint:** **Mon 2026-06-08 (open)** — the daily **forward capture must RUN**, stacking gap-free history (critical path **D1 → 1C → 1G**). **Fri 2026-06-12** — platform **functional**: full dashboard (1I) + working **stress-test page** (Phase 2) + a **start of page 3** (Phase 3); first two pages operational; infra running continuously, good enough to read the market and make trade decisions.

> **▶ Priority update (owner, 2026-06-10) — the daily capture now RUNS automatically.** The Mon
> "capture must RUN" goal is **met**: the 429 transport backoff (`0c255ba`) + overwrite re-fire
> ([ADR 0041](../.agent/decisions/0041-eod-refire-overwrites-rather-than-skips.md), `962809f`) make

> each land raw+snapshots+surfaces — validated live, both indices. **Depends only on the IBKR
> gateway being up.** **Near-term priority order:** (1) **confirm ≥2 clean days banked** (Wed+Thu)
> for the Fri review; (2) **[POST-CAPTURE-backend-audit](POST-CAPTURE-backend-audit.md)** — owner-
> requested full backend audit, run once days are banked; (3) **[daily-bar-compaction](daily-bar-compaction.md)**
> (rulings recorded, ready) + **[ohlc-constituent-backfill](ohlc-constituent-backfill.md)**; (4)
> **T-raw-invariant #1/#2** after QA-FIX lands; (5) Fri platform — front 1I (main goal) + stress
> page + page-3 start. **Obsolete:** the "clear ledger + partitions before the real close" /
> intraday-dry-run-purge guidance — ADR 0041 makes the real close **overwrite** an intraday run, so
> no manual purge is needed any more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR TOMORROW'S PROFESSOR REVIEW (Fri 2026-06-12):**
> 1. **Data Quality & EOD Capture:** Verify that tonight's EOD captures (SX5E/SPX) are 100% clean and fully populated (no 429 drops, no empty derived tables).
> 2. **BFF/Projection Fixes:** Correct F-BFF-04 (fallback axis moneyness keys) and F-SURF-01 (flat discount factor rates to zero) so that the vol surface / Greeks display correctly.
> 3. **Constituent Charts:** Launch the [ohlc-constituent-backfill](ohlc-constituent-backfill.md) so constituent candlestick charts are not empty.
> 4. **CDC Page 1 Reflow:** Complete Page 1 front-end phases 1-3 ([front-page1-cdc-buildout](front-page1-cdc-buildout.md): reading-order reflow, smile side-by-side, 2D heatmap) to look fully compliant with the cahier des charges.

### Ingestion-stack remediation (audit 2026-06-10) — **ADRs accepted, tasks queued**

An ingestion-stack audit (2026-06-10) found the raw layer is not durably guaranteed: two
`RawMarketEvent` schemas coexist with no bridge, raw-landing is a conditional side-effect across
five divergent persist entrypoints, `persist_outputs` silently skips empty tables, and the run
ledger is per-stage. Observed fallout: **SX5E 2026-06-10 persisted every derived table but no
`raw_market_events` and no `projected_option_analytics`.** Reconciled against the blueprint (three
**violations** + one gap) and the ADRs. **Three ADRs accepted** (owner ruled OQ-A…D, 2026-06-10):

| ADR (accepted) | Task | Covers | Status |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| [0039 raw-schema bridge + sample regen](../.agent/decisions/0039-raw-schema-bridge-and-sample-regeneration.md) | [T-bridge](T-bridge.md) | dual-schema + hand-made samples | ✅ **DONE** (`28ab59c`) — closes the [ADR 0021](../.agent/decisions/0021-analytics-core-merge.md) deferral; SX5E sample now needs only a gateway capture |
| [0041 re-fire overwrites not skips](../.agent/decisions/0041-eod-refire-overwrites-rather-than-skips.md) | — (in `pipeline.py`) | the `(trade_date,stage)`-only ledger making the 2nd per-calendar timer skip its index | ✅ **DONE** (`962809f`) — both timers now capture; self-heals intraday pollution |
| [0040 ingestion persistence invariants](../.agent/decisions/0040-ingestion-persistence-invariants.md) | [T-raw-invariant](T-raw-invariant.md) | raw-before-derived guard (#1/#2); complete-or-flagged + per-run completion (#3/#4 → **fold into QA-FIX** per OQ-D) | **QUEUED** — high care; #1/#2 sequenced after QA-FIX (overlaps `run_state`/`collectors`/`cp_rest_close_capture`/`storage/adapter`). 0041 already covers the multi-timer facet. |

Before writing any test, read [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) — the shared test-surface contract and the
converged seam → contract-test map. Code without the named tests is not done.

  current scale nothing should). The scale lever for the small-files problem is **cold-compaction by
  ticker** (merge old `(date, underlying)` files into `(underlying, month|year)`) — built **only when a
  measured threshold is crossed** (adding SP500, or file-count/query-latency past a bound), never
  speculatively. Non-blocking; lives behind the `StorageRepository` port over cold data only.
  **▶ THRESHOLD NOW CROSSED (2026-06-10):** S&P500 backfill landed → `daily_bar` is **419 755 files /
  4.9 GB for ~20 MB of real data** (1 row/file, ~250× overhead). Spec written:
  [daily-bar-compaction](daily-bar-compaction.md) — **rulings recorded (OQ-1…4, 2026-06-10: 1 file/ticker,
  hot/cold cold-only compaction, archive-then-delete, daily_bar only); ready, awaiting go on implementation.**
- **[OHLC constituent backfill](ohlc-constituent-backfill.md) — queued (2026-06-10), unclaimed.** Per-component
  candlesticks are empty for most names (all SX5E EU, NVDA…) — only index underlyings + some US names have
  `daily_bar`. Root cause diagnosed: `ohlc_backfill.py` over the **attended Gateway** is impractically slow
  (the `conid=0` warmup 503 + data-farm transient 503s → ~3 names/10 min), though the raw Gateway history
  endpoint is fast for real conids (curl-verified). Fix the warmup/503 handling + clean the SX5E seed
  (drop the `VGM6` future, verify EU conid resolution), then run for SPX+SX5E. Coordinate with daily-bar-compaction.
- **[Page-1 CDC build-out](front-page1-cdc-buildout.md) — queued (2026-06-10), unclaimed.** Tab-1 base is
  shipped (`ad97c6c`: control bar+QC badge, index/constituent history, 3D surface, smile, dollar-Greeks term
  structure). Missing the rest of the cahier des charges: **vol scorecards (§3.3)**, **nappe heatmap (§3.4)**,
  **ATM term structure (§3.5)**, **Greeks-vs-strike shape cards (§3.6)**, global maturity selector. Phased; 2+3
  are data-backed today, 5 waits on path A, colours out of scope until the §6 styling pass.
- **[H1 — repo-hygiene audit](archive/H1-repo-hygiene-audit.md) — ✅ landed (2026-06-06, against `e0ab3ab`).**
  Read-only classification done; report at [H1-repo-hygiene-report.md](archive/H1-repo-hygiene-report.md).
  Outcome: **no tracked dead paths** (nothing to `git rm`). Applied safe patch — added the five
  missing tool-cache patterns to `.gitignore` (`.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`,
  `.hypothesis/`, `.import_linter_cache/`; all were untracked) and `rmdir`'d the two empty
  never-tracked merge stubs `.agents/` and `.codex/`. `Test Lenny/`, `Vincent's Code/`, `ThomasOssen/`
  left in place and flagged. Gate green. `Vincent's Code/` on-disk removal stays a `matthieu`/admin
  step (see below).
- **[H2 — doc reconciliation](archive/H2-doc-reconciliation.md) — ✅ landed (2026-06-06, against `e0ab3ab`).**
  Report: [H2-doc-reconciliation-report.md](archive/H2-doc-reconciliation-report.md). The **gate-wired
  freshness guard** is in (`packages/infra/tests/test_doc_freshness.py`, 33 cases: README coverage,
  symlink resolution, map routes every area, no dead doc links). Audited all 18 infra-module + 8
  package READMEs; fixed five concrete drifts (four C7 "param is now typed config, not a `.py`
  literal" in forwards/iv/surfaces/risk + execution's layer position). Glossary gained the merge
  terms (config bundle, push collection seam / `RawCollector`). `map.md` verified current; the docs
  index gate command fixed (it omitted `lint-imports`). The blueprint data-dictionary vs code
  contract field-name split was raised as OQ-7 and **ruled (owner, 2026-06-06): follow the
  blueprint, code conforms** — the six field renames (`forward_price`/`implied_vol`/`log_moneyness`/
  `scenario_pnl`/`qc_status`/`dollar_*`) landed across contracts + producers/consumers + tests +
  docs; data starts fresh so no migration. See
  [ADR 0029](../.agent/decisions/0029-contract-field-names-conform-to-blueprint.md). Gate green
  incl. the new check.
- **`Test Lenny/`** is a throwaway standalone experiment, not canonical and imported by nothing. Now
  **untracked** — removed from the repo (`git rm --cached`) and gitignored, **kept on disk** for the
  admin to delete. Its README flags it as ignore-me. So it is excluded from any GitHub push.
- **`Vincent's Code/` removal** was blocked during C5 (the dir is owned by `matthieu`; the C5 process
  ran as `vincent`, so `rm` was permission-denied — the clone is intact). It is gitignored and not
  canonical, so it does not affect the gate; its README should be flagged as reference-only (see the
  banner queued for `matthieu` to apply). Remove it as `matthieu` (then drop its `pyproject`/
  `.gitignore` excludes) whenever convenient. Not blocking.
