# T-clean-ingestion-2026-06-16 — purge the constituent-option junk + full recompute-from-raw (06-15 & 06-16), re-capture 06-17 live

> ## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-17 — by PRUNING, not recompute (do NOT recompute these days)
> **Root cause (the "recompute degenerates" bug is NOT in the code):** the run-partition casse
> accumulated 37–42 close fires — each with a **different option chain** — under one `session_id`.
> The raw is the **union** of those chains (06-15: 976 option instruments vs the 724 of the real
> close), so recompute-from-raw feeds the SVI fit an **incoherent superset** → fit fails → 0
> projected (06-15). The fire boundaries are lost: **recompute-from-raw cannot reproduce a single
> clean close for these damaged days.** (The replay pipeline itself is correct — validated on clean
> input; see [ADR 0057](../../.agent/decisions/0057-replay-reuses-the-live-pipeline-one-path.md).)
>
> **The clean close already existed** as the `underlying=SX5E` partition (written live by ONE fire):
> 06-15 proj=435, 06-16 proj=522. `store.read` was inflating to 20,283 by **summing SX5E + the 48
> constituent partitions** (scope junk), not the `run=` dirs. **Fix = prune:** keep `underlying=SX5E`,
> drop every `run=` dir + every constituent `underlying=` partition + the retired
> `constituent_capture_outcomes` table, across raw + all computed layers. `daily_bar` (50 constituent
> price series = the realized-vol input) untouched. Result: front reads clean 435 / 522, faithful
> original values, zero recompute. Backups retained under `data/_provisional_archive/` until owner
> sign-off. **06-17** is left to tonight's close cron (C1.2 overwrite ⇒ one clean slot).

**Status:** ✅ resolved (pruning) 2026-06-17 — archived. **Lane:** `platform-` (data ops).
**Owner ruling (2026-06-17, Vincent):** *"clean the raw of everything that isn't Stoxx50 options or daily bars, EMPTY all the computed layer, recompute from the cleaned raw, and re-capture today's live end-to-end."*
**Depends on:** the recompute-from-raw bug in §0 being fixed FIRST. **Relates:** [ADR 0051](../.agent/decisions/0051-return-to-blueprint-dispersion-realized-vol-diagnostic.md) (index options only; constituent option capture retired), blueprint Part XV (raw Tier-1, all derived recomputable from raw), [T-restore-overwrite-last-wins](T-restore-overwrite-last-wins.md) (the C1/C2/C1.2 overwrite fix — **landed** `5a5abf4`).

## 0. ⛔ BLOCKER — recompute-from-raw is INCOMPLETE (fix before any recompute)

> **Step 1 LANDED `b9e60e2` (2026-06-17).** `reconstruct_day`/`reconstruct_range` now thread
> `provider=DEFAULT_PROVIDER` + `session_open=False` into `run_analytics`, and `_persist_outputs` /
> `_record_count` include `projected_option_analytics` — so the vol-nappe projection + pricing
> regenerate from raw (the 20,283-row → 0 collapse is fixed). Regression pins the seam. **Still
> open: steps 2–3** (extend reconstruct to also run `persist_signal_set` + `run_qc`, then the
> full row-count-match regression). Blocker is NOT fully cleared — do not recompute yet.

A live verification on 2026-06-17 proved `rebuild_from_raw` / `reconstruct_day` does **not** reproduce
the front's data from raw — recompute would silently **blank the vol nappe**:

- Original 2026-06-16 had **117,216** `projected_option_analytics` rows (SX5E = 20,283). A
  `rebuild_from_raw` recompute produced **0** projected rows + **0** `pricing_results` (snapshot / iv /
  surface rebuilt fine).
- **Root cause:** `_build_projected_analytics` (`actor/driver.py:606`) early-returns `()` when
  `provider is None`. The live eod passes `provider="IBKR"` (`eod_stages._analytics`); but
  **`reconstruct_day` has no `provider` param at all** (`reconstruction/batch.py:52`) → `run_analytics`
  gets `provider=None` → zero projected + zero pricing on **every** recompute.
- **Also missing from reconstruct:** `strategy_signals` (ρ̄ / dispersion) and `qc_results` /
  `triage_records` are **not produced by `reconstruct_day` at all** (only the 9 `REBUILT_TABLES`).

This violates blueprint Part XV ("all derived recomputed from raw"). **Fix required before recompute
— OWNER RULING (2026-06-17): Option 1, full recompute (analytics + signals + qc):**

1. Thread `provider` (default `DEFAULT_PROVIDER = "IBKR"`) through `reconstruct_day` → `run_analytics`
   so `projected_option_analytics` + `pricing_results` regenerate. Verify `_persist_outputs` writes them.
   (Mirror the live eod `_analytics`: also `session_open=False`.)
2. **Extend `reconstruct_day` to also run `persist_signal_set` (ρ̄ / dispersion) + `run_qc`** for the
   day — so recompute-from-raw is blueprint-true Part-XV complete (analytics + signals + qc all
   regenerated). It already holds `config`; thread the signal config + qc thresholds.
3. Regression test: recompute a known day from raw → `projected_option_analytics` row count matches the
   live run (non-zero, within reconstruct's collapse semantics) + signals + qc present. **Own ADR/bug task.**

---

## 1. Approach (owner-ruled, blueprint-conform)

**One clean rule for the raw:** keep only **(a) SX5E option-chain events** and **(b) constituent
`daily_bar` prices** (the realized-vol input for Eq. 23 / ρ̄). Everything else in the close-capture
lane is ADR-0044/0045 junk (constituent option chains, pre-0051) → **purge**.

1. **Clean the RAW** of all non-{SX5E-options, daily_bar} partitions for the junk days.
2. **EMPTY the entire computed layer** (snapshot + derived + analytics + signals + qc) for those days —
   no surgical per-partition keep; wipe and recompute.
3. **Recompute** from the cleaned raw (needs §0 fixed).
4. **Re-capture 2026-06-17 live end-to-end** (the cron re-fetches at close anyway) — doubles as the
   live ingestion test of the landed overwrite-last-wins fix.

## 2. Scope — which days, which junk (mapped 2026-06-17, nothing mutated yet)

`raw_market_events` by `trade_date`:
- **06-12**: `SX5E` only → already clean, no action.
- **06-15**: 9 underlyings (ALV ASML ENR MC SAP SIE SU TTE + SX5E) → **8 constituent junk** → clean.
- **06-16**: **49** underlyings (SX5E + 48 constituents) → the big junk day → clean.
- **06-17**: `SX5E` only (ADR-0051-correct scope) → raw clean, but **2-fire accumulation** (captured
  pre-C1.1) → re-capture live e2e supersedes it.

**Junk footprint to purge (verified on a temp copy — full-clean validated):**
- `raw/raw_market_events` — 48 (06-16) / 8 (06-15) constituent `underlying=` partitions.
- `raw/instrument_master` — constituent option masters for the junk days.
- `reference/discovery_conid_cache` — constituent conid caches for the junk days.
- `qc/constituent_capture_outcomes` — **entire table is ADR-0051-RETIRED** → delete it wholesale (all dates).
- All computed: `snapshot/market_state_snapshots`, `derived/*` (forward_curve, iv_points, surface_*,
  pricing_results, risk_aggregates, scenario_results), `analytics/projected_option_analytics`,
  `signals/strategy_signals` (**provider-nested**: `provider=IBKR/trade_date=…`), `qc/qc_results`,
  `qc/triage_records` — wipe each `trade_date=DAY` dir (incl. all 42 `run=` + constituent subdirs).
- **KEEP / untouched:** `raw/daily_bar` (constituent **prices** = realized-vol input, separate backfill lane).

## 3. Validated facts (temp sandbox `/tmp/c3_fix`, zero canonical touch)

- Purge of all the above → 06-16 ends with **0 `run=`, 0 non-SX5E underlying** (excl. daily_bar), 0 retired table.
- `rebuild_from_raw --index SX5E`: snapshot 132,669 → **2,369 rows, 0 dups, SX5E only**; `reconstruct_day`
  ran clean (**no `DuplicateKeyInBatch`** — the prior failure was pre-C2, now resolved), raw hash-verified.
- BUT `projected_option_analytics` + `pricing_results` came back **0** → the §0 blocker.

## 4. Safety / order — **stage-in-temp, promote-after-validation (owner-ruled 2026-06-17)**

**No in-place `rm -rf` on canonical.** Build the cleaned+recomputed days in a **temp staging copy**,
validate fully, then **promote** (atomic swap) — the previous canonical kept as a deletable archive.
This makes the whole op reversible up to the final owner sign-off; no annoying irreversible loss.

- **Order:** ① fix §0 bug (+ regression test) → ② stage a temp copy of the junk days (06-15, 06-16)
  → ③ in the temp copy: purge junk (raw → SX5E-options + daily_bars only) + **wipe all computed** →
  ④ recompute in temp (analytics + signals + qc, via the §0-fixed reconstruct) → ⑤ **validate the temp
  result** (non-zero projected nappe, ρ̄, QC, zero junk) → ⑥ **promote** temp → canonical, moving the old
  canonical day-dirs into a `data/_provisional_archive/<day>-pre-cleanup/` → ⑦ re-capture 06-17 live
  e2e → ⑧ owner validates the front (nappe + ρ̄ + QC) → ⑨ **delete the provisional archives +
  `_rebuild_backups`** (no shadow data).
- A 210M archive for 06-16 already exists from an earlier pass; the promote step supersedes/refreshes it.

## 5. Acceptance

- 06-15 & 06-16 raw = **SX5E options only** (+ `daily_bar` untouched); zero constituent option junk anywhere.
- Computed layer fully recomputed from raw, **including non-zero `projected_option_analytics`** (front
  nappe reads), ρ̄ signals, and a current-code QC verdict; zero `run=` partitions; retired
  `constituent_capture_outcomes` table gone.
- 06-17 re-captured live end-to-end, one clean slot (overwrite-last-wins, no accumulation).
- Provisional archives + rebuild backups deleted after owner sign-off.

## 6. VALIDATE-ONLY run — measured results (2026-06-17, data-ops, temp sandbox, zero canonical touch)

Executed §4 ①–⑤ against a full TEMP copy of the store at `/tmp/c3_cleanup_20260617-161244/data`
(rsync from canonical, excluding `_provisional_archive` + `_rebuild_backups`). **⑥–⑨ deliberately NOT
done — owner-gated.** Canonical proven untouched after the run: 06-16 still 49 underlyings, 06-15 still
9, 1052 `run=` dirs intact, `constituent_capture_outcomes` still present, raw 06-15+06-16 sha256
byte-identical before/after.

**Purge (temp only):** raw → SX5E only for both days; `instrument_master`/`discovery_conid_cache`
non-SX5E underlyings dropped; `constituent_capture_outcomes` removed wholesale; all computed wiped;
`daily_bar` kept (228,111 parquet files intact). Result: 0 `run=` dirs and 0 computed partitions for
06-15/06-16; 06-12/06-17 untouched.

**Recompute — TWO defects found in the recompute-from-raw path (the §0 fix alone is NOT sufficient):**

1. **`DuplicateKeyInBatch` on BOTH days via `rebuild_from_raw.py`.** `rebuild_day` (line 220) calls
   `store.read("instrument_master")` with **no `trade_date` filter** → pulls all four stored days'
   masters → **7,380 masters / only 2,637 distinct keys (2,413 dup keys)** → `build_snapshots` writes
   two snapshot rows per duplicated key → `DuplicateKeyInBatch`. The live EOD path never hits this
   because `_analytics` scopes masters to the *single captured day's* `basket.masters`. **Fix:** dedup
   masters by `instrument_key` before reconstruct (last-wins). Verified: with a deduped-masters driver,
   both days reconstruct clean, no dup error. *This is a real bug in the recompute path, not staged.*

2. **The original "20,283" SX5E projected rows were themselves accumulation-inflated.** Canonical 06-16
   SX5E `projected_option_analytics` = 20,283 rows = only **177 distinct (tenor, delta_band) cells**,
   each duplicated 9–43× at the same `snapshot_ts`/`model_version`. The deduplicated recompute yields
   **501 rows (167 combined + 167 put + 167 call), SX5E only** — the *correct* nappe. The "20,283"
   acceptance figure was the junk this cleanup removes, NOT a target. **Acceptance "non-zero projected"
   is MET; front nappe will read the 167-cell combined surface.**

**Measured TEMP results after deduped recompute:**

| metric | 2026-06-16 (load-bearing) | 2026-06-15 (thin/messy day) |
|---|---|---|
| `market_state_snapshots` | 2,369 (SX5E only; matches canonical SX5E-slice) | 976 (OPT only — see below) |
| `projected_option_analytics` | **501** (167 comb + 167 put + 167 call), SX5E | **0** ⚠ |
| `strategy_signals` (ρ̄) | **8 rows, SX5E** | 0 (no projected → no signal) |
| `qc_results` / `triage_records` | 2 / 2 (verdict **fail**: 1m interior delta-band gap — honest QC, not a crash) | 0 / 0 |
| `DuplicateKeyInBatch` | none (after dedup) | none (after dedup) |

3. **06-15 recompute produces ZERO projected nappe — a raw data-quality deficiency, day-specific.**
   The 06-15 SX5E *index* (`SX5E|IND`) has only **2 raw events all day** (one `last`, one `volume`,
   split across a 15:30 close instant **and a second 20:00 fire** — the pre-fix accumulation). No
   two-sided book → index snapshot raises `InsufficientSnapshotData` → skipped → no usable spot →
   projection short-circuits → 0 cells → 0 signals. Canonical 06-15 had a (145-distinct-cell)
   projection from its original capture context. **This is sparse 06-15 index raw, not a cleanup flaw;
   06-16 is unaffected.** Owner should decide whether 06-15 is worth keeping at all (it is thin and the
   index quote is degenerate) before promote.

**Verdict:** the 06-16 staged+recomputed temp day is **clean and valid** (junk-free, non-zero deduped
nappe, ρ̄ present, real QC verdict, no dup error). 06-15 is junk-free but yields an empty nappe due to
a degenerate index quote in its raw. Promote /
re-capture-06-17 / owner-front-validation / archive-deletion (⑥–⑨) remain **owner-gated and were not
performed.** Temp store retained at `/tmp/c3_cleanup_20260617-161244/data` for inspection.

**Defect 1 FIXED (`6aec3cf`, 2026-06-17):** `rebuild_from_raw.py` now dedups `instrument_master` by
key (`_distinct_masters`, latest `as_of_date` wins) before reconstruct, so the production recompute
path runs end-to-end without `DuplicateKeyInBatch`. The promote is no longer blocked on a code bug.

### Remaining owner decisions before promote (⑥)
1. **Go/no-go on the destructive promote of 06-16** (purge canonical junk + swap in the recomputed
   day). The recompute path is now proven correct on temp; the swap mutates non-git-recoverable
   canonical `data/`, so it wants an explicit owner go.
2. **What to do with 06-15** — its SX5E index raw is degenerate (2 events, sparse), so a clean recompute
   yields an empty nappe. Keep it junk-purged-but-thin, or drop the day. Owner call.
