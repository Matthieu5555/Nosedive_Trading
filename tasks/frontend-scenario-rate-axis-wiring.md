# frontend-scenario-rate-axis-wiring — surface the rate-shock stress axis on the BFF + front

> **Front/BFF slice of [infra-scenario-rate-axis](archive/infra-scenario-rate-axis.md) (landed/archived 2026-06-14).** The
> engine + config landed: `ScenarioConfig.rate_shocks`, a `rate` family in the scenario
> grid (separate parallel sweep, not a 3-D spot×vol×rate cross-product — owner-ruled), and
> the Rho attribution term now fires under a rate scenario. The parent left the **BFF/front
> wiring of the rate axis deferred / front-adjacent**. This is that wiring slice.

## Why (TARGET cite)
TARGET §5.4 (the risk-manager's stress screen: spot ±X%, vol ±X pts, **rates ±X bp**) and
§2 goal — the stress screen is how S2's kill condition and the book's rate exposure get
*seen*. **Provenance note:** the transcript's stress grid is "±50% spot / ±50% vol / **±10%
third axis**", and the third axis being **rates** is the owner's *inference* over a garbled
word — not a clean course mandate. Rates is the sensible reading (and the blueprint lists rate
shocks as an optional scenario family), so this is defensible; just don't cite it as
"course-prescribed". The rate axis traces to TARGET §5.4 + owner ruling, not verbatim to the transcript. The rate family is now produced by the engine but the stress-surface BFF
(`/api/risk/scenarios`, `/api/basket/scenarios`) and the Risk Scenarios / Basket-stress
front panels only render the spot×vol surface — the rate sweep reaches no screen. This
layer owns "carry it through to the operator's stress screen, labelled in bp and dollars".

## Scope boundary
- **In:** surface the `rate` scenario family through the stress-surface serializer and the
  `/api/risk/scenarios` + `/api/basket/scenarios` payloads (a labelled rate sweep beside
  the spot×vol surface); add the matching `api.ts` types; render it on the Risk Scenarios
  page and the Basket on-demand stress action (a rate-shock selector / row, each cell
  labelled with its bp shock and its dollar reprice delta). Reuse the existing
  `StressSurface` component idiom; honest empty state when `rate_shocks` is empty
  (backward-compatible — no rate family, no rate panel).
- **Out:** the scenario engine, the additive forward-fixed rate shock, the Rho term wiring,
  and the grid-shape ruling — all landed in the parent. Never re-shock or re-reprice in the
  BFF; serialize the engine's rate-family valuations. The full 3-D spot×vol×rate
  cross-product is explicitly **not** the shape (owner ruled a parallel sweep).

## Dependencies / coordination
- Reads the landed `rate` family from infra-scenario-rate-axis (engine + config on main).
- A rate-shock stress is only fully meaningful once Rho bumps a **real** curve
  ([infra-rates-curve-ingest](infra-rates-curve-ingest.md), R1) — note the dependency, but
  the additive forward-fixed sweep is renderable today against the parity-implied rate.
- Coordinate the Risk Scenarios / Basket page edits with the anthony lane (Basket/Risk tab
  operator-flow fixes) — shared-tree hazard on `pages/RiskScenarios.tsx` / `pages/Basket.tsx`.

## Done criteria
The rate-shock sweep is in the `/api/risk/scenarios` + `/api/basket/scenarios` payloads and
renders on the Risk Scenarios page + Basket stress action, each cell labelled in bp and
dollars; empty `rate_shocks` renders no rate panel (backward-compatible); no reprice
re-implemented in the BFF; Python BFF tests + web gate green.

## Landed (2026-06-17, gate green) — persisted Risk Scenarios path

The persisted half is **done and on `main`**: the engine's `rate_` family (already banked in
`scenario_results`) is now serialized through `/api/risk/scenarios` as an additive `rate` sweep
(`n_rate`) — `rate_scenarios_to_list` buckets each `rate_<±shock>` per shock, labelled with its
`rate_shock` (fraction), `bp`, book-summed `scenario_pnl` and `n_legs`, sorted ascending; the BFF
serializes the banked valuations and **re-shocks nothing**. `scenario_result_to_dict` now carries
the previously-dropped `rate_shock` on every cell. The web Risk Scenarios page renders a new
`RateSweep` panel (in `StressSurface.tsx`, reusing the panel idiom) beside the surface, mounted
only when `rate` is non-empty — an unconfigured grid renders **byte-identical** to before. Types in
`stressApi.ts` (`RateScenario`), BFF tests (`test_risk_api.py` + `rate_client`/`seed_rate_store`),
web component + page tests, and an e2e rate-panel test all landed; full gate green (Python
2434 passed / 12 skipped; web lint + 217 vitest + build; risk-scenarios e2e 4/4).

## Deferred — on-demand Basket rate sweep

`/api/basket/scenarios` still carries **no** rate sweep. The basket stress engine
(`apps/frontend/.../basket_scenarios.py::basket_stress`) reprices spot×vol only (`stress_surface`);
emitting a rate family there is a *new* on-demand reprice in the BFF — outside this slice's file
scope and against the parent's "never re-shock/re-reprice in the BFF" boundary. It is a clean
follow-up: have the basket engine sweep the landed `scenario_grid` rate scenarios over its
reconstructed legs (reusing `scenario_line_pnls`/`scenario_totals`), serialize through
`basket_scenarios_to_dict`, and render the shared `RateSweep` in `StressTab`. The front + types are
already rate-aware, so lighting up the basket is additive.
